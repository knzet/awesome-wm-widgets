# srcery awesome theme by McSinyx

## A few side notes

* First 9 colors in srcery palette along with orange
* are exposed for convenient theming.
* The backgrounds are pixel-based, for best result please resize them using a
  proper algorithim, e.g. in GIMP use *None* interpolation.
* Titlebar and wibox use some pixel arts,
* so please keep theme at the size of 28px.
* I added some 28-pixel high arrows to the theme.
  One might wanna use them to rice your desktop in the *powerarrow* way.
